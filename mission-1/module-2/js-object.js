/**
 * Object is non-primitive data type
 */

/**
 * - String : text data
 * - Number : numeric data
 * - Boolean : `true` or `false`
 * - Null : intentional absence of value (`void` in some other language)
 * - Undefined : absence of value due to not yet being initialized
 * - BigInt : Very big numeric value
 * - Symbol : Works as a unique identifier
 */

/**
 * Key Difference
 * - Mutability: Primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once assigned. Non-primitive data types are mutable and can be modified.
 * - Storage: Primitive data types are stored directly in memory, whereas non-primitive data types are stored as references to their values in memory.
 * - Comparison: Primitive data types are compared by value, while non-primitive data types are compared by reference.
 * - Examples: Numbers, strings, and booleans are examples of primitive data types, while objects, arrays, and functions are examples of non-primitive data types.
